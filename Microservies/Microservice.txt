# MicroService- Microservices are a modern approach to software whereby application code is delivered in small, manageable pieces, independent of others.

=========================================================================

# Why build microservices? ----> Their small scale and relative isolation can lead to many additional benefits, such as easier maintenance, improved productivity, greater fault tolerance, better business alignment, and more.

# MONOLITH VS MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE -----> 

SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE --> 

Software architecture defines the structure of a system, its components, and the way they interact with each other.
Two common types of architectures are:

1- Monolithic Architecture

2- Microservices Architecture

=========================================================================

1- MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE

Definition:
Monolithic architecture is a traditional software architecture where the entire application is built as a single unit.
All components such as user interface, business logic, and database access are tightly coupled and deployed together.

Characteristics:

Single codebase

Single deployment unit

Shared database

Tightly coupled components

Structure:
UI
Business Logic
Data Access
(All combined into one application)

Advantages:

Simple to design and develop

Easy to deploy and test

Better performance due to no network calls

Suitable for small applications

Disadvantages:

Difficult to scale

Hard to maintain as application grows

Any change requires full redeployment

Single point of failure

Technology flexibility is limited

Use Cases:

Small or simple applications

Startups in early stages

Low traffic systems

==================================================================================

2- MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE

Definition:
Microservices architecture is a design approach where an application is divided into small, independent services.
Each service performs a specific business function and communicates with other services using APIs.

Characteristics:

Multiple independent services

Separate codebases

Independent deployment

Each service can have its own database

Loosely coupled architecture

Structure:
User Service
Order Service
Payment Service
(Each service runs independently and communicates via APIs)

Advantages:

Easy to scale individual services

High fault tolerance

Faster development with parallel teams

Supports multiple technologies

Continuous deployment is possible

Disadvantages:

Complex architecture

Network latency between services

Difficult data consistency

Requires advanced DevOps and monitoring

Testing is more complex

Use Cases:

Large and complex applications

High traffic systems

Enterprise-level software

Applications requiring frequent updates

# DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MONOLITH AND MICROSERVICES

Architecture:
Monolith - Single unified application
Microservices - Multiple independent services

Deployment:
Monolith - One deployment
Microservices - Independent deployment for each service

Scalability:
Monolith - Entire application is scaled
Microservices - Individual services are scaled

Database:
Monolith - Single shared database
Microservices - Separate databases per service

Fault Tolerance:
Monolith - Low
Microservices - High

Complexity:
Monolith - Simple
Microservices - Complex

========================================================================================================

# Stateless services --> A stateless service is a service that does not store any client session or request-related data between requests.

Each request is treated as independent and complete.

The service does not remember previous interactions. (For example Login Services)

========================================================================================================

#Service Decomposition-> 

Service decomposition is the process of breaking a large application or system into smaller, independent services, where each service performs a specific business function.

It is a core concept of microservices architecture.
